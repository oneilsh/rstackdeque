Description: Provides fast, persistent (side-effect-free) stack, queue and
    deque (double-ended-queue) data structures. While deques include a superset
    of functionality provided by queues, in these implementations queues are
    more efficient in some specialized situations. See the documentation for
    rstack, rdeque, and rpqueue for details.
